This is my journal of the design and building process of **Frequency Counter for Function Generator**.

## 10/19/2025 - Idea Time!  

Designed the blocks I need to make here.

Considered the output levels of the function gen (5VTTL) and the logic level of the MCU (3v3) as well as the obvious need for input protection in the lab environment.

We will of course need to pass thru the sync signal for use by other equipment, so added that in. Seeing as I'm turning the signal into a 3v3 one anyway, might as well add a switch to select it.

We will need a shift register (probably SN74HCT595 because that's what I'm used to) to drive the Segment Displays. An N-FET based PWM brightness adjustment is also added.

The STM32 gets USB access so I can use this in automated testing setups as well. We will end up just printing the current freq over USB at 50 Hz or whatever.
